Multi-pass compressor control table.

The multi-pass compressor control table is designed to allow control of the twave 
parameters and synchronize parameter changes with the operation of the compressor. 
The table is a simple string of characters with all commands being a single 
character. The table also contains parameters and these are always whole number 
parameters and they follow the command character. There are two types of commands, 
state change commands and twave parameter commands.

State change commands stop the execution of the table until the state has completed, 
for example a C or compression command will stop the table execution until a full 
compression cycle has finished.

Twave parameter commands execute immediately and change controlling parameters 
such as voltages and timing parameters.

State change commands
	N		Normal non-compressed twave cycle
	C		Compression cycle
	D		Delay, holds current state and stops the clock

Twave parameter commands
	S		Controls the output switch state, 1 and 0 for open and close
	O		Compression order or ratio
	V		Twave 1 pulse voltage
	v		Twave 2 pulse voltage
	F		Twave frequency
	c		Compression time in mS
	n		Normal time in mS, a compression cycle is the sum of c and n
	t		Non compression cycle time
	s		Stop the twave clock
	r		Restart the twave clock
	[		Start of a loop
	]		End of a loop

Compression table commands are case sensitive. Below are a number of compression 
table commands that illustrate the capability.

	Both of the following tables show 2 compression cycles followed by 2 normal cycles. 
	Note that the repeat or count parameter follows the command and its assumed to be 1 
	if not defined.

	The following table shows changing parameters before defining twave states. In this 
	case the compression time is set to 200mS, the twave channel 2 pulse voltage it set 
	to 30 volts and the order is set to 5 then a compression cycle is executed. When the 
	compression cycle finishes the twave channel 2 voltage is set to 50 then another 
	compression cycle is executed followed by 2 normal cycles.

	This final example shows how the looping capability works. In this example the 
	commands enclosed by the [â€¦] are repeated the number of times defined by the number 
	that follows the ], in this case 10.
